The R code for the paper "Sequential weighted uniform design"

1. The R files, "AUD_WCD.R","AUD_WWD", are used to constrcut the sequental weighted uniform design via the enhanced stochastical evolution (ESE) algorithm. 

2. The R files, "AUD_CD.R", "AUD_WD.R", are used to constrcut the augmented uniform design with the general discrepamcies. 

3. "discrepancy.R" includes the calculation of the (weighted) discrepancies, CD, WD, WCD and WWD. 

4. "OTL Circuit", "Borehole" and "Wing weight" includes the design points (with the filenames "xxx.txt"), esitimation of weight vector (with the filenames "xxx_SSZGP.R") and prediction comparison corresponding to the section 4.2 in the paper.
